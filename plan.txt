New organizational plan:

command.c -- accessed by main loop, still employs an array of struct commands and calls the appropriate callback
	     now contains a function to add in callbacks

client.c -- registers handlers for the following commands: NICK, USER, MODE, QUIT(maybe), PASS(if ever implemented), OPER(maybe in stat)
client_stat.c -- registers handlers for the following commands: WHO, WHOIS, WHOWAS (low priority)
channel.c -- registers handlers for JOIN, PART, INVITE, KICK
channel_stat.c -- registers handlers for TOPIC, NAMES
server -- registers handlers for OPER, QUIT, PRIVMSG, PING
server_stat -- registers handlers for MOTD, VERSION, LUSERS, LIST, INFO
