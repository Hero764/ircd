OUTLINE FOR A SERVER:

Database:

-list of servers it is connected to
-list of clients it is connected to:
	struct client:
		char *pass;
		char *nick;
		char *user;
		int sock;	
	struct channel:
		struct client *joined[MAX_JOIN];			
		char chan_name[20];
		c	
-list of channels 

Functionality:

-main loop which polls open sockets for incoming messages or connection requests (main.c):
	-one socket which continuously listens for incoming connects
	-one socket for each client
-parsing commands (main.c)
-sending and receiving bytes from the network (network_io.c)
-managing channels (channel.c)
-register a connection (register.c)

in formulating a response:
-first a handler for the command and its arguments is called
-response can contain one or many messages
-write_message()
-handler directly writes to connection socket

single message response commands:
-pass
-nick
-user
-
